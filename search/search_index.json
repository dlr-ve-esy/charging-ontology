Python","text":"<p>A significant part of our work builds on the efforts coming from other ontology projects, particularly the OEO and the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). This requires scripting which can vary a lot with operating systems. To reduce the overhead from stepping in we recommend using python whenever possible. Python is also used to build this documentation using the incredible MkDocs library. Python can be acquired in many ways, some examples might be their official site, package managers like anaconda or app stores like the Microsoft store. We suggest you install it your (or your company) preferred way.</p>"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#2-poetry","title":"2. Poetry","text":"<p>As previously mentioned, python can come from many sources.

Java platform","text":"<p>Most mature ontology development tools rely on the OWL API which runs in the Java platform. To use most of the software we need to work with ontologies you need to have a working Java installation. Please refer to the installation instructions from OpenJDK.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>There is an alternative API called horned-owl which is written in Rust and can be made compatible with Python. It is however still in development but we may have the chance in the future to move away from Java into a pure Python environment.</p>"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#4-protege","title":"4.

We may consider moving to tawny-owl but since it requires setting up Clojure, and we already add many dependencies we postpone this. Also, the point-and-click pattern of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, while not efficient is easier to introduce to non-programmers.</p>"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#4-git","title":"4.

As part of their success reporting channels, they offer a data register where stakeholders can consult the availability and development of said infrastructure. The data contained in these reports can be used to evaluate spatial and temporal distribution, technical properties of the infrastructure, numbers per operator, charging capacities among other things. Stakeholders can use this information in their decision-making process to contribute to the realization of the law associated with the register. Citizens, government and independent parties can consult the data to ensure that the law is working as intended and can be used as part of a feedback loop for future improvements. Electric vehicle users can consult the register in their travel decisions, but this is not the main application as there are other tools for such queries, most of which are available in the vehicles themselves.</p> <p>The information detail expected in such dataset has different dimensions. First and probably the most relevant is geospatial data, such as addresses and coordinates; land use polygons could be of interest but not for all applications. Secondly are details about the operation, such as commissioning/decommissioning dates and operators. Lastly are technical details interesting for other parties, for example the kind of connectors that are compatible with a station, since not all autos have the same kind of connection, current type and charging capacity are interesting for both grid operators and road infrastructure managers. Detailed description of the infrastructure capacity such as number of columns and parking places per installation can be also of interest.</p> <p>Since this registry is intended to provide visibility of the infrastructure. Information of the daily operation of the infrastructure is not so relevant, specially because such data can very rapidly enter the realm of big data.
