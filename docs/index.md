# Welcome to the CHIO documentation

The **CHarging Infrastructure Ontology (CHIO)** is an ontology project aiming to
formalize terms and definitions associated with the charging infrastructure of
battery electric vehicles. This ontology can be used as it is or as a submodule
to larger ontologies in sectors like power systems and transport research.
