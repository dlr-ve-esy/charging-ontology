# Application scenarios

To aid the ontology development and setting the boundaries on what belongs what
doesn't we rely in application scenarios which are textual descriptions of
situations in which the ontology might be used. These descriptions are then
complemented with [competency
questions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2019.100534) derived from them.
These scenarios are not exhaustive, feel free to propose both real and theoretical
scenarios.

## Scenario 1 - The charging infrastructure register

### Summary

This scenario is heavily inspired by the existence of the [German charging
infrastructure
register](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/ElektrizitaetundGas/E-Mobilitaet/start.html),
and it probably captures most of the requirements of this ontology. The
scenario covers terminology and axioms necessary to perform descriptions in
regard to where infrastructure is found, which power they are able to deliver
and what kind of connector they have.

### Competency questions

## Scenario 2 - My awesome scenario

### Summary

Some short description of the scenario, where does it come from and what use
cases it intends to cover.

### Description

The main text of the scenario, be as specific as possible, this section can be
a citation from some paper or other kind of content.

### Competency questions

List of competency questions in plain text, they don't need to be strictly questions, they can also be affirmations. For example:

> - Is a dog considered a passenger?
> - A shopping trip is a leisure trip
