\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Questions on electrification of the transport sector and other research trends
have as ultimate goal to put a stop to climate-change driving carbon emissions.
These study fields deal with complex systems whose boundaries tend to differ
based on the research questions themselves. These differences become
troublesome when exchanging data because in most cases the person producing it
is not always available to clarify misunderstandings. Metadata improves this
situation significantly, but their content is also subject to interpretation.
While ontologies can't solve problems of ambiguity, they can ease them by
offering a way of explicitly declare semantics. With this small ontology
project we intend to offer a reference point for communication not only between
transport and energy researchers but also any person whose work involves this
small component of larger infrastructure systems.
