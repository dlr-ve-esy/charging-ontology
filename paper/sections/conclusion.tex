\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Questions on electrification of the transport sector and other research trends
have as the ultimate goal to put a stop to climate-change driving carbon
emissions. These study fields deal with complex systems whose boundaries tend to
differ based on the research questions themselves. These differences become
troublesome when exchanging data because, in most cases, the person producing it
is not always available to clarify misunderstandings. Metadata improves this
situation significantly, but their content is also subject to interpretation.
While ontologies can't solve problems of ambiguity, they can ease them by
offering a way of explicitly declaring semantics. With this small ontology
project, we intend to offer a reference point for communication not only between
transport and energy researchers but also any person whose work involves
electric vehicle charging stations which are components of larger infrastructure
systems. The ontology development is streamlined thanks to the preparation
effort that we invested. We consider that the methodology we used to prepare the
environment can be re-utilized for other ontologies. An important part was taken
already from what we learned from the OEO development. In further works, we
expect to use our approach to create, map, and expand ontologies usable for
transportation research and cover other niches that are out of the scope of the
OEO.
