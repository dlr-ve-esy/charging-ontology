\section{Results}
\label{results}

At the time of this publication the ontology has an open git
repository\footnote{Note for the editors: The publishing of the repository is
being subject to export control, we would update the links accordingly in the
camera ready version. }. This repository has a developer documentation where the
motivating scenarios along their competency questions are written. A quick
introduction for developers is also part of this documentation. This
documentation is written using exclusively markdown files which can be rendered
into webpages with different packages, we opt for using
MkDocs\footnote{https://www.mkdocs.org/} because of its simplicity. For the
ontology documentation and the IRI resolution we are still exploring solutions.
We are tending towards Widoco\footnote{https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco}.

We implemented a python test suite that allows the incremental development of
the ontology using competency questions. This suite classifies the queries in
two types. Those who act on the class level (TBox) like \hyperref[CQ1.1]{CQ 1.1}
and those that act on the individual level (ABox) like \hyperref[CQ2.0]{CQ 2.0}.
To handle the ABox queries we rewrite the natural language questions as ASK
SPARQL queries that return either true or false values and declare a model in
Turtle Syntax that instantiates the referred classes. For example
\hyperref[CQ2.0]{CQ 2.0} is written as listing \ref{lst:1} and its corresponding
model \ref{lst:2} populates the ABox. The TBox questions are evaluated by
evaluating entailment using DL queries such as the one in listing \ref{lst:3}
which corresponds to \hyperref[CQ1.1]{CQ 1.1}.

\begin{listing}[h]
    
    \begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{sparql}
        ASK WHERE {
            SELECT (COUNT(?parkingSpaces) AS ?vehicleCapacity)  
            WHERE  {  :SomeParkingArea obo:BFO_0000178 ?parkingSpaces . }
            HAVING ( ?vehicleCapacity = 2 ) }
    \end{minted}

Since we aim to a high rate of reusability, most of the efforts have been aimed
towards finding concepts from existing ontologies. We import the entire CCO
version of the BFO which already includes basic RO axioms. We import  the
excerpts from OEO and CCO mentioned in section \ref{methodology}, we do this by
providing scripts that ensure transparency and reproducibility. These scripts
point to specific versions of the ontologies that can be updated based on
developing needs. In some cases we reimplemented terms and pointed out the ones
from other ontologies by using mappings. This was the case for the axioms from
the TPSO Parking Ontology (figure \ref{parkingfig}). Our interpretation of
parking areas and spaces is similar, but we rely on the mereology of BFO,
instead of assign the charging stations to parking spaces directly we opt for
utilizing the facility axioms from CCO These implementations can be visualized
in figure \ref{parkingchio}.
