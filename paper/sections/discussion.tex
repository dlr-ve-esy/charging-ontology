The next milestone is to complete the terminology associated with the first two
scenarios. Followed by a demonstration application based on scenario one using
the FAIR version of the German network agency data that we extracted for
\cite{ArellanoRuiz.2024}.

One important open issue is hosting of the ontology. Currently, we use the
namespace of the Open Energy Platform, but we are not sure if they would
consider it part of the scope of their project. One alternative could be
upcoming repository of ontologies often mentioned in the discussion board of
the CCO. At the time of writing this paper we propose having this discussion
during the workshops of these proceedings.
