\section{The need of a charging infrastructure ontology}

The need of an ontology that represents entities and phenomena associated with
charging infrastructure was noticed first during the process of implementing
the FAIR principles on the data published by the German Network Agency
\cite{ArellanoRuiz.2024}. There we noticed that the existing ontologies and
vocabularies where insufficient to annotate concepts like charging plug type.
After a short discussion in the OEO development
forum\footnote{https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/issues/1597} we
came to the conclusion that thing like `power plug' and potential subclasses
of the same are beyond the scope of the ontology. Along concepts like `parking
place' or `mobility mode', which are concepts that are often used during
transport research analyses, it has been hard to argue to include them in the
ontology, despite them being used during cross-domain analyses like
\cite{Hecht.2022}. This need is deeply explored by \cite{Mittermeier.2023}, but
their approach used to address it relied mostly on including the terms in the
OEO which we consider not viable in the long run.
