\section{Development status and future roadmap}
\label{achievment}

At the time of this publication the ontology (hopefully) has an open git
repository. This repository has a documentation where the motivating scenarios
along their competency questions are written. A quick introduction for
developers is also part of this documentation. Infrastructure for automatic
evaluation of competency questions as well as consistency checks are
implemented. We also import the entire CCO version of the BFO which already
includes basic RO axioms. We also implement reproducible steps to import
concepts reutilized from the OEO and CCO, these steps point to specific
versions of these ontologies.

The next milestone is to have implemented the terminology associated with the
first two scenarios. Followed by a demonstration application based on scenario
1 using the FAIR version of the German network agency data that we extracted
for \cite{ArellanoRuiz.2024}.

One important open issue is hosting of the ontology. Currently, we use the
namespace of the Open Energy Platform, but we are not sure if they would
consider it part of the scope of their project. One alternative could be
upcoming repository of ontologies often mentioned in the discussion board of
the CCO. At the time of writing this paper we propose having this discussion
during the workshops of these proceedings.
