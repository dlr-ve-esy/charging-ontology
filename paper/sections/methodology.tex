\subsection{Application Scenarios}

\subsubsection*{Scenario 1: The charging infrastructure register}

This scenario is heavily inspired by the German charging infrastructure
register \cite{Bundesnetzagentur.27Oct2023}, and it probably captures most of
the requirements of this ontology. The scenario covers terminology and axioms
necessary to perform descriptions in regard to where infrastructure is found,
which power they are able to deliver and what kind of connector they have.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 2: iCity Project Smart Parking Applications}

This scenario is an extract of the iCity project by Katsumi and Fox.
Particularly the section smart parking applications \cite{Katsumi.2020}. These
are selected examples of the subset of questions relevant to us. They are
interesting because charging infrastructure is intimately connected with
parking infrastructure. These queries rely on a lot in geographical queries and
may overlap with scenario 1, but they have a perspective more in line with
daily operation of the stations. For more details on the ontology visit its
