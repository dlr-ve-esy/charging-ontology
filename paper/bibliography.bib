@article{Nguyen.2021,
 abstract = {Data visualization blends art and science to convey stories from data via graphical representations. Considering different problems, applications, requirements, and design goals, it is challenging to combine these two components at their full force. While the art component involves creating visually appealing and easily interpreted graphics for users, the science component requires accurate representations of a large amount of input data. With a lack of the science component, visualization cannot serve its role of creating correct representations of the actual data, thus leading to wrong perception, interpretation, and decision. It might be even worse if incorrect visual representations were intentionally produced to deceive the viewers. To address common pitfalls in graphical representations, this paper focuses on identifying and understanding the root causes of misinformation in graphical representations. We reviewed the misleading data visualization examples in the scientific publications collected from indexing databases and then projected them onto the fundamental units of visual communication such as color, shape, size, and spatial orientation. Moreover, a text mining technique was applied to extract practical insights from common visualization pitfalls. Cochran's Q test and McNemar's test were conducted to examine if there is any difference in the proportions of common errors among color, shape, size, and spatial orientation. The findings showed that the pie chart is the most misused graphical representation, and size is the most critical issue. It was also observed that there were statistically significant differences in the proportion of errors among color, shape, size, and spatial orientation.},

 abstract = {Data structures in Julia to enable power systems analysis. Also, PowerSimulations.jl is a Julia package for power system modeling and simulation found at https://github.com/NREL/PowerSimulations.jl. The objectives of the package are: Provide a flexible modeling framework that can accommodate problems of different complexity and at different time-scales. Streamline the construction of large scale optimization problems to avoid repetition of work when adding/modifying model details. Exploit Julia's capabilities to improve computational performance of large scale power system simulations. The flexible modeling framework is enabled through a modular set of capabilities that enable scalable power system analysis and exploration of new analysis methods. The modularity of PowerSimulations results from the structure of the simulations enabled by the package: Simulations define a set of problems that can be solved using numerical techniques. Problems are generated by expressing model formulations against system data For example, an annual production cost modeling simulation can be created by formulating a unit commitment model against system data to assemble a set of 365 daily time-coupled scheduling problems.},

@article{Janssen.2020,
 abstract = {Being able to replicate research results is the hallmark of science. Replication of research findings using computational models should, in principle, be possible. In this manuscript, we assess code sharing and model documentation practices of 7500 publications about individual-based and agent-based models. The code availability increased over the years, up to 18{\%} in 2018. Model documentation does not include all the elements that could improve the transparency of the models, such as mathematical equations, flow charts, and pseudocode. We find that articles with equations and flow charts being cited more among other model papers, probably because the model documentation is more transparent. The practices of code sharing improve slowly over time, partly due to the emergence of more public repositories and archives, and code availability requirements by journals and sponsors. However, a significant change in norms and habits need to happen before computational modeling becomes a reproducible science.},

 abstract = {This data article refers to the paper {\textquotedbl}Analysis of residential EV energy flexibility potential based on real-world charging reports and smart meter data{\textquotedbl} [1]. The reported datasets deal with residential electric vehicle (EV) charging in apartment buildings. Several datasets are provided, with different levels of detail, aiming to serve various needs. The paper provides real-world EV charging reports describing 6,878 charging sessions registered by 97 user IDs, from December 2018 to January 2020. The charging reports include identifiers, plug-in time, plug-out time and charged energy for the sessions. Synthetic charging loads are provided with hourly resolution, assuming charging power 3.6 kW or 7.2 kW and immediate charging after plug-in. The non-charging idle time reflects the flexibility potential for the charging session, with synthetic idle capacity as the energy which could potentially have been charged during the idle times. Synthetic hourly charging loads and idle capacity are provided both for individual users, and aggregated for users with private or shared charge points. For a main garage with 33{\%} of the charging sessions, smart meter data and synthetic charging loads are available, with aggregated values each hour. Finally, local hourly traffic density in 5 nearby traffic locations is provided, for further work related to the correlation with plug-in/plug-out times. Researchers, energy analysts, charge point operators, building owners and policy makers can benefit from the datasets and analyses, serving to increase the knowledge of residential EV charging. The data provides valuable insight into residential charging, useful for e.g. forecasting energy loads and flexibility, planning and modelling activities.},

@article{Andrenacci.2021,
 abstract = {Background: The correct design of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructures is of fundamental importance to maximize the benefits for users and infrastructure managers. In addition, the analysis and management of recharges can help evaluate integration with auxiliary systems, such as renewable energy resources and storage systems. EV charging data analysis can highlight informative behaviours and patterns for charging infrastructure planning and management. Methods: We present the analysis of two datasets about the recorded energy and duration required to charge EVs in the cities of Barcelona (Spain) and Turku (Finland). In particular, we investigated hourly, daily and seasonal patterns in charge duration and energy delivered. Simulated scenarios for the power request at charging stations (CSs) were obtained using statistical parameters of the Barcelona dataset and non-parametric distributions of the arrivals. Monte Carlo simulations were used to test different scenarios of users' influx at the CSs, and determine the optimal size of an integrated renewable energy system (RES). Results: This study highlighted the difference between fast and slow charging users' habits by analysing the occupancy at the charging stations. Aside from the charge duration, which was shorter for fast charges, distinct features emerged in the hourly distribution of the requests depending on whether slow or fast charges are considered. The distributions were different in the two analysed datasets. The investigation of CS power fluxes showed that results for the investment on a RES could substantially vary when considering synthetic input load profiles obtained with different approaches. The influence of incentives on the initial RES cost were investigated. Conclusions: The novelty of this work lies in testing the impact of different approach to design synthetic profiles in the determination of the optimal size of a photovoltaic (PV) system installed at a charging infrastructure, using the economic criterion of the net present value (NPV).},

 abstract = {The importance of taking individual, potentially conflicting perspectives into account when dealing with knowledge has been widely recognised. Many existing ontology management approaches fully merge knowledge perspectives, which may require weakening in order to maintain consistency; others represent the distinct views in an entirely detached way.  As an alternative, we propose Standpoint Logic, a simple, yet versatile multi-modal logic {\textquotedbl}add-on{\textquotedbl} for existing KR languages intended for the integrated representation of domain knowledge relative to diverse, possibly conflicting standpoints, which can be hierarchically organised, combined and put in relation to each other.  Starting from the generic framework of First-Order Standpoint Logic (FOSL), we subsequently focus our attention on the fragment of sentential formulas, for which we provide a polytime translation into the standpoint-free version. This result yields decidability and favourable complexities for a variety of highly expressive decidable fragments of first-order logic. Using some elaborate encoding tricks, we then establish a similar translation for the very expressive description logic SROIQb{\_}s underlying the OWL 2 DL ontology language. By virtue of this result, existing highly optimised OWL reasoners can be used to provide practical reasoning support for ontology languages extended by standpoint modelling.},

 abstract = {This paper provides empirical data and a profitability estimation of public charging infrastructure usage in Germany. Given that, in Germany, there are now 2.5 times as many vehicles per charging station compared with 2017, the system needs to allocate charging points efficiently. To this end, this paper presents representative data on energy consumption, arrival times, occupation, and estimated profitability of 22,200 charging stations in Germany. The observed patterns are translated into compact empirical models that allow working with the results without the burden of the large-scale datasets. Charging happens mainly during the day and on weekdays for AC charging stations, whereas DC fast-charging stations are more popular on the weekend. Fast-chargers service approximately three times as many vehicles per charge point at higher profits because of better margins. For AC chargers, up to 20~kWh of energy are charged in an average charge event, whereas fast-chargers supply approximately 40~kWh. Energy transfer typically terminates after 4~h for AC chargers and 45~min for fast-chargers. The power rates are significantly below the rated station power and rarely exceed 11~kW for AC charging. This paper allows fellow researchers to build simulation and test scenarios using presented data or to verify models.},

@article{Fattahi.2020,
 abstract = {We reviewed the literature focusing on nineteen integrated Energy System Models (ESMs) to: (i) identify the capabilities and shortcomings of current ESMs to analyze adequately the transition towards a low-carbon energy system; (ii) assess the performance of the selected models by means of the derived criteria, and (iii) discuss some potential solutions to address the ESM gaps. This paper delivers three main outcomes. First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current ESMs and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of MARKAL, TIMES, REMix, PRIMES, and METIS. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated ESM is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model.},
