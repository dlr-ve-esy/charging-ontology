# TODO and development roadmap

## 26.02.2024

This ontology project is a small practical application intended for
demonstration of the concepts explored in one of my publications. This should
serve as practice for ontology development. Initial setup requirements:

- [] Set documentation environment up using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and probably the [gitbook theme](https://gitlab.com/lramage/mkdocs-gitbook-theme).
- [] Setup of the testing framework using competency questions.
- [] Write down the use case scenarios (these are also going in the paper).
- [] Decide in a proper name (CHIO?)
- [] Decide on the ontology term conventions, maybe use identifiers with the following form "CHIO_XXXXXXXX"
- [] Import the necessary OEO Terms.
