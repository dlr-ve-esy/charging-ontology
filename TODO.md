# TODO and development roadmap

## 27.02.2024

I set everything up to have a working developer documentation, this has still
to be filled with more content.

- [ ] Setup CI to render docs.
- [ ] Consider adding documentation versioning.

This ontology project is a small practical application intended for
demonstration of the concepts explored in one of my publications. This should
serve as practice for ontology development. Initial setup requirements:

- [x] Set documentation environment up using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)~~, and probably the [gitbook theme](https://gitlab.com/lramage/mkdocs-gitbook-theme)~~.
- [ ] Setup of the testing framework using competency questions.
- [ ] Write down the use case scenarios (these are also going in the paper).
- [ ] Decide in a proper name (CHIO?)
- [ ] Decide on the ontology term conventions, maybe use identifiers with the following form "CHIO_XXXXXXXX"
- [ ] Import the necessary OEO Terms.
