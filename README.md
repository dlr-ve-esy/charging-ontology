# Charging infrastructure ontology

This is a bfo-based charging infrastructure ontology, intended as a tool for
the demonstration of the "Ontology first data-model design" methodology part of
the doctor thesis of [Eugenio Arellano](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2508-3976). 

## Requirements

This ontology requires an initial setup. First the user needs a working java
installation, both OpenJDK and the oracle releases should work properly. Then
it is necessary to install the following tools:

- [ROBOT is an OBO Tool](https://github.com/ontodev/robot): We recommend you
  download it with the provided script.
- [Desktop Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- Python and poetry to use the scripts.
- Visualizations require [graphviz](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/) and
  [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html#windows-install)
  which are relatively hard to install in windows. We recommend following the
  instructions in their respective webpages.

## Contact
